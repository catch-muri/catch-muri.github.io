Matt Fredrikson is an Associate Professor in Carnegie Mellon's Computer Science Department and Institute for Software Research, and is a member of CyLab and the Principles of Programming Group. His research areas are security & privacy, fair and trustworthy artificial intelligence, and formal methods. He is currently working to understand the unique problems that can arise in data-driven systems, which often incorporate machine learning for greater automation or to aid with decision-making. Oftentimes these systems pose a risk to the privacy of end-users and data subjects, unwittingly introduce new forms of discrimination, or jeopardize safety and security in adversarial settings. His goal is to find ways to identify these issues in real, concrete systems before they cause harm, and methods to construct new ones with rigorous guarantees of safety and accountability.
