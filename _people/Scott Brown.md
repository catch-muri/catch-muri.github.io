Since earning his PhD in 2002, Prof Scott Brown has focussed on applying mathematical modelling techniques to the understanding of higher-order cognitive processes (mostly memory and decision-making). He spent four years as an Assistant Professor at UC Irvine, and then took up a position at the University of Newcastle. Brown has been supported in research-only positions by the Australian Research Council from 2008-2016 (a Queen Elizabeth II Fellowship, then a Future Fellowship). He shares a lab with a strong group of math-psych researchers. His research work combines basic cognitive science to understand human psychology and behaviour, with applied work investigating human performance can be understood and improved in critical situations.
