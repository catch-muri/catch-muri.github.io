Blaine Hoak is a Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the Pennsylvania State University. She works in the Systems and Internet Infrastructure Security Laboratory and is advised by Prof. Patrick McDaniel. Her current research focuses on the security of machine learning systems, specifically adversarial machine learning. Blaine is interested in understanding how adversaries can leverage model information to design sophisticated attacks. In the future she hopes to extend this work into the medical space as well, and how the challenges unique to this domain impact adversarial capabilities.
