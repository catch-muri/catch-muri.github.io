Clement Fung is a Societal Computing PhD student in the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University, advised by Lujo Bauer. He is a member of CyLab, the security and privacy institute at CMU. Clement's research focuses on problems at the intersection of machine learning, security, and cyber-physical systems. Currently, he is investigating novel techniques for ML-based anomaly detection in industrial control systems. Some of his past research projects include (i) client-side, ML-based detection of DOM-XSS vulnerabilities and (ii) attacks and defenses for multi-party federated learning systems. Clement finished his M.Sc. in computer science in 2018 at the University of British Columbia, where he was a member of the Networks, Systems and Security (NSS) Lab. He built systems for private and secure multi-party machine learning with Ivan Beschastnikh. Clement finished his B.A.Sc. Systems Design Engineering in 2016 at the University of Waterloo, with several internships spanning a wide variety of projects: from developing tools for bio-informatics research to building large-scale, online machine learning infrastructure with LinkedIn.
