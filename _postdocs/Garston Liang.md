Garston Liang received his PhD in experimental psychology from The University of New South Wales, Sydney investigating the cognitive processes that guide a decision-maker’s choices with algorithms. Using cognitive models and experimental methods, he’s interested in understanding how users conceptualise the capabilities of advisor systems and, subsequently, how this understanding affects engagement with algorithmic tools.
