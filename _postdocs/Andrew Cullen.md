Andrew Cullen is a postdoctoral research fellow at the University of Melbourne. His work is heavily driven by the security implications of machine learning, working on problems that improve the robustness of machine learning systems against adversarial manipulation. This work spans data protection, privacy, minimising the risk of manipulation by motivated actors, and protecting proprietary models. Andrew has previously worked in wireless networking, reinforcement learning, and organisational planning. He received a PhD in Applied and Computational Mathematics from Monash University in 2018, for his work in developing a novel, class leading algorithm for solving nonlinear, variable coefficient differential equations, with a focus upon applications to Fluid Mechanics and Turbulence. Andrew also holds Bachelors degrees in Aerospace Engineering (Honours) and Science, and an additional Honours degree in Applied Mathematics, also from Monash University.
