Tyler Malloy is a post-doctoral researcher with Carnegie Mellon University's DDM lab. He received his PhD in Cognitive Science in 2022 at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, New York. His research interests include cognitive modeling of human perception, learning, and decision making. During his time at RPI, Tyler was a part of the IBM Artificial Intelligence Research Collaboration where he worked alongside IBM researchers on human-inspired reinforcement learning. As a member of the Dynamic Decision Making Lab, Tyler will explore how humans quickly learn new tasks in contexts like cybersecurity that require decision making under risk and uncertainty.
