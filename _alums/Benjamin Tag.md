His research interest is located in the fields of Human-Computer Interaction and Context-Aware Systems. He is investigating ways to quantify and understand human emotion and cognition by combining methods from the fields of cognitive psychology and ubiquitous computing. He is specifically interested in deploying off-the-shelf devices (e.g., Smartphones) in everyday settings to enable long-term mental state assessments and to inform the design of targeted interventions that foster well-being and knowledge acquisition.
