excerpt: New floating-point and timing side-channel attacks against differential privacy implementations
---

CATCH researchers PI [Olya Ohrimenko]({{ "investigators/Olya Ohrimenko.html" | relative_url }}), PhD student [Jiankai Jin]({{ "phds/Jiankai_Jin.html" | relative_url }}) and PI [Ben Rubinstein]({{ "investigators/Ben Rubinstein.html" | relative_url }}) have presented [their work](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.05307) on systems implementation flaws in differential privacy, last week at the prestigious 2022 IEEE Symposium on Security & Privacy (also known as 'Oakland') in San Francisco. Demonstrating new flaws in floating-point rounding and timing side-channel attacks, found in industry-standard implementations by Google and Facebook/Meta, the work was recognized by an [Honorable Mention in Google's Bug Hunter program](https://bughunters.google.com/profile/1e5f9da7-e8d5-42dc-be8b-cc576152232a) due to its impact on the Google Differential Privacy library. The work also resulted in a patch to [Facebook/Meta's Opacus library](https://github.com/pytorch/opacus/pull/260) for privacy-preserving deep learning.
