CATCH MURI's fourth all-hands meeting, marking the end of Year 2, was a June 2023 workshop held at the UC San Diego node of CATCH, in the beautiful Franklin Antonio Hall. 

The two-day workshop ended with a full morning of student presentations, highlighting some of the best work of the project. Attendees toured parts of the UCSD campus and enjoyed a group dinner, generously hosted by UCSD.
