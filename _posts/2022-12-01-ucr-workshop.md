CATCH MURI's third all-hands meeting was a joint workshop with the [MURI on Autonomy in Cyberspace through rObot learning and Man-BOt Teaming](https://autocombot.eng.ucsd.edu/research-team). As sister MURIs, AutoCoMBOT and CATCH were both funded by ARO in the same topic-year. 

The November 2022 meeting was generously hosted by [Prof Heng Yin](https://www.cs.ucr.edu/~heng/) at UC Riverside. Heng was also General Chair of CCS 2022, attended by several MURI and AUSMURI researchers right before the joint meeting, in nearby Los Angeles.

The joint meeting was an excellent opportunity for researchers from the two MURIs and AUSMURI to network and share ideas across many areas of mutual interest. With ARO PM Cliff Wang moving to NSF, we thanked Cliff for his fantastic support and guidance, and welcomed Paul Yu who has joined MaryAnne Fields in the ARO PM team.
