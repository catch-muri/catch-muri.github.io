Our first MURI-AUSMURI annual Review and Research progress workshop was a great success!

Truly amazing research talks and discussions addressing Human Behaviour, Psychology research, Robustness of AI and all the ongoing research is a testament to the talent and dedication of everyone involved.

Our project on Cybersecurity Assurance for Teams of Computers and Humans (CATCH) convenes researchers from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, Carnegie Mellon University, UC San Diego, Penn State University, University of Melbourne, Macquarie University, and University of Newcastle. It was an absolute pleasure to spend 2 days with academic faculty, postdocs, and students from these institutions as well as partners from US Army Research Office, the U.S. Office of the Secretary of Defense, and Australia's Defence Science and Technology (DST).

We were honoured to host Dr Bindu Nair, Director of Basic Research, U.S. Department of Defense, and hear her perspectives on national cooperation, basic research, and advice for successful MURIs.

What a great kick off to a future of continued success and collaboration!
