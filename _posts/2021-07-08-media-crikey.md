The {{ site.center_name }} was mentioned in a piece on Crikey:

> AI is not being used just to dig through a large jumble of online data to sift for facts and fiction or pick friends from foes. Seven universities are involved in looking at how AI can be used with human intervention to deal with cybersecurity threats.
> 
> University of Wisconsin-Madison, Carnegie Mellon University, University of California San Diego, and Penn State, along with three Australian universities — University of Melbourne Macquarie University, and University of Newcastle — have formed a multidisciplinary team to look at developing the technology behind what they call human-bot cybersecurity teams (HBCT).
> 
> This project has scored \$3 million from the federal government as part of the US-Australia International Multidisciplinary University Research Initiative to look into how AI or machine learning can help lessen the load for those involved in managing cybersecurity threats.
> 
> Professor Benjamin Rubinstein, the principal investigator, told Crikey that 16 experts from those universities will be involved in finding answers to conundrums such as how AI systems can better interact with humans, and also grappling with how to make it harder for attackers trying to ram open the digital doors of institutions.
