Effective coordination of human-bot teams is a grand challenge for cybersecurity. While machine learning bots reduce the burden on human
analysts by filtering information, cybersecurity poses unique challenges for human-bot teams as active adversaries adapt to changing
conditions. This project aims to develop rigorous science for human-bot cybersecurity teams, with the goal of developing cohesive teams that are
robust to active human and machine learning adversaries.
